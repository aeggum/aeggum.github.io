<ul>
    <li>If eating acidic foods or drinks, it's best to wait a little while or to drink some water before brushing your teeth.  Not doing so *can* damage the enamel, as it's weakened after the acid.</li>
    <li>China has used more cement in the past few years than the USA has in the past hundred.  That's awful, especially when you consider how they are trying to emulate the US (my point here being the driving culture).</li>
    <li>Keto is an interesting diet (<50 net carbs a day), I wouldn't mind giving it a try someday.</li>
</ul>
