    I enjoyed that this book gives you another view into the life of Jobs. It makes him seem much more human and less of an asshole or god.
  notes:
    - People grow a lot over the course of their lives, you should take every oppurtunity to learn something new, even in failure.
    - “Pixar’s Ed Catmull likes to say that since you can’t control the luck itself, which is bound to come your way for better and for worse, what matters is your state of preparedness to deal with it.”
    - “I’ve always thought there are a number of things that you have achieved at the end of a project,” he says. “There’s the object, the actual product itself, and then there’s all that you learned. What you learned is as tangible as the product itself, but much more valuable because that’s your future.” - Jony Ive

    I did not enjoy this book for the first half, it seemed to choppy the way he jumped around the timeline a lot. But over the course of the book I grew accustomed to it and really began to enjoy it. It gives you a very grim view of the effects of war
  notes:
    -So it goes.
    - "Derby described the incredible artificial weather that Earthlings sometimes create for other Earthlings when they don’t want those other Earthlings to inhabit Earth any more."
    - "Trout, incidentally, had written a book about a money tree. It had twenty-dollar bills for leaves. Its flowers were government bonds. Its fruit was diamonds. It attracted human beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer. So it goes."

    Great book, though I have listened to their podcast for awhile so many of the stories were not new. Some of the examples they gave seemed a tad specific to the situation, but I think their model of thinking can be translated to your daily life.
  notes:
    - Apparently I didn't highlight or note anything in this whole book, which is odd.
    - I really enjoyed the Van Halen and Brown M&Ms story

    I loved this book. I especially liked the contrast between the Narrator wanting to keep his job and life the way it was and Tyler wanting to make people notice him, and to completely throw away any parts of his past life. I feel like I could identify with both of them in some ways.
  notes:
    - Having seen the movie beforehand meant I read the whole book knowing the details of the relationship between Tyler and the Narrator. It seemed incredibly obvious, but it made for a very interesting read.
    - The ending was far better and more memorable than the movie, but books are always that way.
    - I feel like I know how to make TNT now.
