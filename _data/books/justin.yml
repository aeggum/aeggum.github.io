  review: >
    I enjoyed that this book gives you another view into the life of Jobs. It makes him seem much more human and less of an asshole or god.
  notes:
    - People grow a lot over the course of their lives, you should take every oppurtunity to learn something new, even in failure.
    - “Pixar’s Ed Catmull likes to say that since you can’t control the luck itself, which is bound to come your way for better and for worse, what matters is your state of preparedness to deal with it.”
    - “I’ve always thought there are a number of things that you have achieved at the end of a project,” he says. “There’s the object, the actual product itself, and then there’s all that you learned. What you learned is as tangible as the product itself, but much more valuable because that’s your future.” - Jony Ive
