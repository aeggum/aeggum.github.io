  review: >
    I really enjoyed the writing style of the book, along with the bits of knowledge and various ways in which Levitt approaches a question.
  notes:
    - People respond to incentives; everyone from a drug dealer to a real estate agent to a child to a CPS teacher
    - Don’t fret parenthood too much; it’s mostly genetics, combined with effort as the child grows up
    - Combined with empathy, try to think about why people act the way they do

  review: >
    I stuck with the same authors and essentially this felt like I was reading an extension of the same book.
    The main difference here was that there was less of a focus on random questions and more on 'self help' and different things that can be done to improve your life.
    There were still a lot of random questions, and plenty of "consider this ..."
  notes:
    - Learn how to say “I don’t know” - “I don’t know, but I will try to find out”.  Feedback is the key to any economic study.
    - Redefine the question; instead of “I need to eat more, how can I do that?”, ask “How can I make eating easier?"
    - Don’t assume that pre-defined targets are really the best that can be done.
    - The brain is the biggest limitation; not the heart or the muscles
    - Find the root cause of a trend
    - Think about things from a different perspective; don’t follow the herd
    - Social incentives tend to be very effective in reality (along with money, of course - but money is usually harder to come by)
    - Quitting can often be a good thing
    - Think about the money you don’t have to spend to determine something was a terrible idea all along
    - Sunk cost vs. concrete cost vs. opportunity cost
    - Don’t trust conventional wisdom
