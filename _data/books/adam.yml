  review: >
    I really enjoyed the writing style of the book, along with the bits of knowledge and various ways in which Levitt approaches a question.
  notes:
    - People respond to incentives; everyone from a drug dealer to a real estate agent to a child to a CPS teacher
    - Don’t fret parenthood too much; it’s mostly genetics, combined with effort as the child grows up
    - Combined with empathy, try to think about why people act the way they do

    I stuck with the same authors and essentially this felt like I was reading an extension of the same book.
    The main difference here was that there was less of a focus on random questions and more on 'self help' and different things that can be done to improve your life.
    There were still a lot of random questions, and plenty of "consider this ..."
  notes:
    - Learn how to say “I don’t know” - “I don’t know, but I will try to find out”.  Feedback is the key to any economic study.
    - Redefine the question; instead of “I need to eat more, how can I do that?”, ask “How can I make eating easier?"
    - Don’t assume that pre-defined targets are really the best that can be done.
    - The brain is the biggest limitation; not the heart or the muscles
    - Find the root cause of a trend
    - Think about things from a different perspective; don’t follow the herd
    - Social incentives tend to be very effective in reality (along with money, of course - but money is usually harder to come by)
    - Quitting can often be a good thing
    - Think about the money you don’t have to spend to determine something was a terrible idea all along
    - Sunk cost vs. concrete cost vs. opportunity cost
    - Don’t trust conventional wisdom

- title: "The Sellout: A Novel"
  author: Paul Beatty

  review: >
    Hilarious at times, and floated plenty of concepts about race, many of which I probably missed.
    Sometimes a little harder to follow, with random flashbacks.
  notes:
    - A little higher level reading-wise, compared to the Freakonomics books
    - Reminds me of Infinite Jest in ways, though it stays from one perspective at all times
    - Got my yearly quota of the racist words
    - I love L.A.  It's the only place where you can go skiing, to the beach and to the desert all in one day white

- title: "One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility"
  author: Zack Furness
  amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592136133
  review: >
    Started and ended really slow (chapters 1 and 7 were hard to get through), but otherwise, a very interesting and informational book about bicycling and all the politics involved.
    I'd never stopped to consider all the effects of the USA car culture, nor consider how poorly bicycling is portrayed in mass media.
    All in all a pretty a solid read.  If I had a star system on this thing, I'd give it 4/5.
  notes:
    - First ever checked out book from CPL; paperback
    - Cycling popularity in the 1890's in some ways paved the way (metaphorically and literally) for cars
    - Eisenhower was fascinated by the autobahn, which prompted the ridiculous 90% + of federal funding for highways, even at a time when cycling was still roughly twice the popularity of driving
    - The Dutch Provo movement in the 1960's was among the first to describe the bicycle as utopian, and to put the bicycle directly against the car politically.  See the White Bicycle Plan.
    - Le monde de Bicyclette, in Montreal. Was very effective.  Montreal now very bike friendly (for NA).
    - 1973, oil crisis, bikes outsold cars
    - Ivan Illich, Jane Jacobs were (still are) important
    - vehicular cycling slowed the rate of bike infrastructure significantly starting in the late 1970s (VC advocates)
    - Critical Mass being decentralized makes it impossible to control.
    - radical flank affect with regards to Critical Mass ("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_flank_effect")
    - Interactions with police keeps blacks and Muslims out of Critical Mass, probably
    - News media sometimes focuses on health benefits, but usually focuses and attention grabbing headlines. Play up injuries and deaths caused by cyclists, ignore or downplay those by cars.
    - Bicycling in general is ignored or negatively displayed in mass media. 40 year old virgin most recent modern example.
    - Car companies ads promoted driving and made cycling a childish thing in the past.
    - Many journalists described car drivers as the victim.
    - Car/bike accident.. is cyclist wearing a helmet??? That kind of thing moves focus away from drivers with huge machines causing injuries/death, to the cyclist.
    - Single speed and fixed bikes are actually seen as cool in time cities, a definite accomplishment
    - Sexism is real in bike culture, too (like car culture)
    - Third world countries still want to emulate the USA's terrible car dependence.. Car companies are powerful.
    - Patrick McHenry quote... "Oh, I cannot make this stuff up. Yes, the American people have heard this. Their answer to our fuel crisis, the crisis at the pumps, is.. Ride a bike.  Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you the Democrats, promoting 19th century solutions to 21st century problems. If you don’t like it, ride a bike. If you don’t like the price at the pumps, ride a bike."
    - Electric car maybe not the answer? (coal power). I’ve never heard of this before.
    - Car has no future in urban areas. Populations are rising. Imagine the gridlock!  Need to change the norm.

- title: "Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"
  author: Susan Cain

  review: >
    A pretty good overview of different general personality traits and how they are perceived culturally.
    There was also some good info about how to optimize yourself based on your personality.
    At times was a little bit overly general, but not too shabby overall.
  notes:
    - 30-50% of Americans are introverts - but most people act as extroverts, at least initially.
    - There's an "extrovert ideal" in USA.  Successful, proud introverts are the exception, not the rule.
    - Not a whole lot new in the first few chapters.  Some CEO's are introverts, some are not.  Many popular functions like UPW or Saddleback church, are all about extroversion and upselling.
    - Interesting that "personality" wasn't even a word 300 years ago.
    - Extroversion is generally considered a "good thing".
    - Open offices are bad, people get dumber when collaborating in large groups
    - The key is to find your optimal level of arousal, mental stimulation wise.
    - Asian cultures are generally more introverted.
    - Conflict resolution can sometimes be a challenge between extro/intro couples, since introverted people (generally) "go into a shell" so to speak and want to avoid conflict.
    - "Some parental advice at the end; best one: when asking your child how school was, as \"what did you do in class today\" instead of \"did you have fun in class today\", that sort of thing."

- title: Between the World and Me
  author: "Ta-Nehisi Coates"
  amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0812993543
  review: >
    A very pessimistic and almost dark book, written as a letter from the 39 year old author to his 15 year old son.
    On one hand it paints a picture of how different life is for some, but also seemingly puts the blame on white people, "dreamers", for not focusing on the terrible history and how they got to prominence.
  notes:
    - Early on mentioned several of the recent names who've been killed via police.  sad
    - Big focus on cops and how they can get away with anything, as this is the world we live in, that kind of thing
    - Made Paris sound fantastic
    - Talked quite a bit about having to "fear for your body" as a black man in America, still the reality for the most part

- title: Zero to One
  author: Peter Thiel
  amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804139296
  review: >
    Quick and intelligent take on what it takes to build a startup and in some ways what the future holds.
    Some of his ideas I hadn't heard before, so it's worth reading especially with what's coming up near term with DC.
    My main issue with this book is that it is loaded with anecdotes, and while Thiel is clearly very smart and knows what he's doing, I won't take what he's said for granted.
  notes:
    - Thiel's initial thesis is that great companies or dominant startups are monopolies.  A company so good at what it does, no other can offer a close substitute.
    - An order of magnitude improvement over existing products, or you will be stuck in furious competiion
    - As has been a common theme in my books thus far, it's very key to be contrarian and to think for yourself.  Not necessarily opposing the crowd, though
    - "When PayPal was in the early days in 1999 an engineer designed a bomb to blow up a competitor .. lesson: don't deprive yourself of sleep"
    - Will this business still be around a decade from now?  Don't focus on short-term growth above all else.
    - Best to be the 'last mover' - to make the last great development in a market and enjoy years of monopoly profits
    - Analysis of definite vs. indefinite optimism and pessimism.  USA has always been optimistic, but since the mid-1970's we've been indefinitely optimistic.
    - "If you think something hard is impossible, you'll never even start trying to achieve it.  Belief in secrets is an effective truth"
    - Tesla received a half BILLION dollar government load at the height of the green tech bubble.  Wow.
    - "7 important questions for every business: breakthrough technology? timing? monopoly? team? distribution? durability? unique opportunity?"
    - I now know what 'The Singularity' is
